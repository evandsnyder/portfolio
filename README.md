# Hi!

If you're here it likely means that you've seen my actual portfolio website, and I'm glad you've come to check out the source code!

This website is a simple React app that was inspired by Brittany Chiang's portfolio site. There's nothing particularly fancy happening. I just wanted a public place for me to share some of my work with potential employers. Feel free to look through the code and my public repositories. When you're ready, reach out to me at [evansnyder16@gmail.com](mailto:evansnyder16@gmail.com)
